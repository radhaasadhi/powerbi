34. A comprehensive guide to Power BI performance tuning

Tuning the data refresh
- 1. Verify the query folding is working..
- 2. Minimize the data you are loding..
- 3. Consider performing joins in DAX not in M..
- 4. Review your applied steps..
- 5. Make use of SQL indexes..
- 6. Use the Powe BI Performance Analyzer..
- 7. confirm that the storge engine is being used..
- 8. Remove data you don't need.

35. How to share reports with people that don't have power bi accounts?
 - You can, but they will have to sign up with a Power BI account. Unless, you send them the PBIX file and they install Desktop.
 - Unless, you use Publish to Web feature, and then they do not need Desktop or an Account.
 - 
36. Why we should create report in Power BI Desktop Instead of Power BI Service?
- Comparing Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service

Power BI Desktop
- Many data sources,Transforming, Shaping & modeling, Measures, Calculated columns,Python,Themes and RLS creation.
Power BI Services
 - Some data sources, Dashboards, Apps & Workspaces, Sharing, Dataflow creation, Paginated reports, RLS management and Gateway connecions.
 IF Combain Both
  - Reports, Visualizations, Security, Filters, Bookmarks, Q&A and R visuals.
